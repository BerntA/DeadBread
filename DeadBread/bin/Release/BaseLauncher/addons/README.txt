Any folder name will be handled like a new skin. 
For example if you want to override some textures inside the base texture folder you just have to copy the files/folders from the base and into the skin folder,
then modify the texture.. 

The directory structure inside BaseLauncher/textures must be the same in the addons/<yourskin>/ folder, or else the textures won't be overriden.
